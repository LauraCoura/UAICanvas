# Canvas Development - Reverse Engineering Process
The following table presents the sections and information of the UAI Canvas filled through a reverse engineering process during the initial development of the framework.

| Section | Information |
| ------- | ----------- |
|Problem|Biology students needed a hands-on lesson before the real-world lab. Thus, the game serves as this class and prepares them for laboratory use.|
|Player/Student|Biology students in the initial years of their study. They are required to prepare for their first visit to the laboratory.|
|Summary|Students explore a virtual laboratory, seeing the class content on the board and being able to go to the next class after following the instructions there.|
|Final mission|Allow the students to explore the virtual laboratory environment and correctly respond to the Quiz.|
|Inspirations|There were no inspirations from other games + Conversations with Biology teachers authors.|
|Pedagogical Content|Instructions for cleaning a microscope and the appropriate materials for the procedure.|
|Learning Objectives|**To memorize** microscope cleaning procedures; **To Memorize** the appropriate cleaning materials; **To Remember** the information learned in order to answer the Quiz correctly|
|Specific tasks|**To Read** the instructions and slides; **To Recognize** the microscope; **To Answer** the Quiz|
|Feedback for teachers|How repeatedly did the student watch the video, see the slide, and answer the Quiz |
|Tips for students|Information about if they got the Quiz question wrong or right.|
|Spatial Interaction and Manipulation|**Player:** To walk, look around and press buttons; **Slides:** go back and move to the next; **Quiz:** show it and answer (you can choose an option between A, B, C and D); **Other non-fundamental interactions: Periodic table:** press the Iron element to show more information; **Video:** pause and start|
|Game world and Embodiment|Science Laboratory with the microscope, bench board, periodic table, and spaces for slides and video|
