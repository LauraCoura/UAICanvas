## Workshop feedback

| Participant | Workshop opinion |
|--------|---|
|**T1**|Exceeded my expectations.|
|**T2**|Objective, inspirational, and very didactic. The proposal, in addition to being extremely relevant to the school environment, was developed with great care and in a clear and practical way.|
|**T3**|It was a time of great interaction and learning. It exceeded my expectations regarding creating an educational digital game|
|**T5**|Interesting workshop that addressed a topic that *(initially)* I'm not very interested in, which is digital games. However, I now have a different view due to the possibilities of applying digital games in the school environment. The workshop showed me how much I can explore games in the classroom, even though we need technology at school. It encouraged me to use the tools we have available as a support tool for student learning. A very accessible workshop for teachers from different areas of knowledge, although in my opinion and with the bit of experience I have, computer science is a very complex area of expertise, but the workshop showed me the possibilities that this area has to offer, in my case, in education. The workshop as a whole had an exciting role as a motivator, in the sense that you go and take the next step, week after week, where ideas became clearer and came together calmly.| 

## Canvas feedback
| Participant | Canvas opinion |
|--------|---|
|**T1**|Despite not being part of my reality as a basic education teacher, the difficulties were overcome with ease, considering all the attention and assistance I received throughout the entire process from the workshop teachers.|
|**T2**|It was an instinctive and very functional experience. I liked the tool and would use it in another project. I congratulate the team for the material and resources presented throughout the workshop.|
|**T3**|This framework helps to summarize and organize the game information.|
|**T5**|Very didactic, and due to the video presentation of Canvas, I had no difficulty. I would definitely use it again. One detail comparing it to the Office package, for example, in Word, when you are typing at the end of the page, it automatically changes pages or opens a new page if necessary. I wonder if it's possible to add this to the Canvas or if it's already like that, and I didn't realize it. Anyway, thanks for the opportunity.|
